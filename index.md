### CPSC 120

* Lab 8

    Lab 8 part 3 was my favorite because I enjoyed creating a graphical image. I was able to write loops along with Chrono literals to make an animated image. Chrono literals were possible with loops throughout each character perfectly enough to make a smooth transition. In this lab the important aspect was using the input_file_stream variable to loop through each letter on the given file to create a graphic once it was done looping through each letter.

* Lab 12

    Lab 12 part 1 was my favorite because I was able to create another graphical image but this time the image was composed of different colors changing. I was able to have my first experience with the math library using sine, with it I was able to use for loops to loop through columns and rows with the given red, green, and blue colors to create panels for each transition.


* Lab 12

    Lab 12 part 2 was my favorite because I was able to display a message on the screen with color-changing pixels in the background. This lab was very interesting, starting with using the coin_flip function and a number generator from 0.0 to 1.0 to display the color on each pixel. To generate different colors I used red, green, and blue and used the coin_flip function to generate the intensity of each color to create a different color for each pixel.
